# News_article_Bias_Score_calculation

In today's rapidly evolving world, many individuals lack the time to access news from diverse sources. Consequently, they rely heavily on a few familiar platforms, whether it's @Facebook, @Twitter, or @GoogleNews. Over time, these platforms curate content from similar sources, creating echo chambers. This is particularly concerning in our current era, where numerous media agencies increasingly showcase polarized content, emphasizing one-sided narratives and agendas rather than neutral reporting.
To address this issue, I propose a new 'bias labeling system'. This system would tag news articles displayed on social media and other platforms with a 'BIAS Label', scoring them between 0 to 1. Here, a score of 1 indicates maximum positive bias, while a score of 0 represents maximum negative bias toward the topic discussed in the article.
Three primary benefits of this approach include:
1. Awareness: It helps readers understand the potential bias of an article. Ideally, they could access three articles on a given topic—two with extreme bias scores and one centered around neutrality—to cultivate a well-informed perspective.
2. Reduction of Polarization: This system can mitigate the effects of polarized media campaigns during critical events like elections or mass protests.
3. Preservation of Free Speech: If expanded to include social media posts, this labeling technique could deter unwarranted censorship, empowering individuals to discern right from wrong.

I have thoroughly tested and developed a BIAS label system using #NLP via pre trained BERT (RoBERTa Model) and GPT4 Large language model.
