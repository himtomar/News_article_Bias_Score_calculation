But this was probably the deepest and widest agenda of not just aspirations, but real deliverable things for our economy, for defence, said America's Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti. Prime Minister Modi last month travelled to the US on his maiden state visit during which he held wide-ranging talks with President Joe Biden. (Reuters photo)By Press Trust of India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic state visit to the United States last month was the \"most extraordinary\" visit in the history of this bilateral relationship, America's Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Thursday.\"We've had some very large moments in the past... But this was probably the deepest and widest agenda of not just aspirations, but real deliverable things for our economy, for defence, the four Ps as I call them, peace, prosperity, \n",
    " the planet and the people that we represent,\" he said.advertisementPrime Minister Modi last month travelled to the US on his maiden state visit during which he held wide-ranging talks with President Joe Biden. Modi also addressed the joint session of the US Congress, becoming the first Indian leader to do so twice.\"It was the most extraordinary visit, I think, certainly in the history of US-India relations,” Garcetti told PTI in an interview.Since the historic state visit, he noted, there has been no let up. \"Both my colleagues in India have said that the Indian government has been following up with a series of meetings to implement the agreements, and we (are) here. One of the reasons I'm in Washington is to keep that momentum going as our president comes to Delhi for the G-20 meeting,” he said.There are so many key deliverables from the visit. Obviously one that got a lot of attention is the GE jet engine deal, which will fundamentally change the level of cooperation we have on the next generation of Indian fighter jets and also integrate our militaries and our defence together, he noted.\"But I can also think of other things like the relaxing of the tariffs and the trade war that we had during the Trump years in which steel was taxed here, and we had American agricultural program products taxed in India. That's a huge change, making something for Indian workers that are in the steel sector and for our agricultural products finally to have free flow. Educational exchange we grew and expanded,” he said.\"The last area is our critical emerging technologies: whether it's artificial intelligence, whether it's quantum computing, whether it's space, or whether it's the telecommunications, I think India and the US really want to cement a deep friendship and co-production, the research and development together of the future underscored by our values,” he said.READ | US-India friendship among most consequential in the world: President Biden\"We can either use technology to hurt people, divide people, or we can use it to connect people, protect people, even detect diseases and heal people. So to me, that was one of the best outcomes, not just for India and the United States, but also for the world,” Garcetti said.advertisementObserving that sky is the limit for US India relationship, he said since the two sides are collaborating in space, maybe even the sky's not the limit. \"We are going from the depths of the ocean to the heavens, in terms of the work that we're doing. Space, the maritime domain,\" he said.\"I think by the end of the year, our leaders will have seen each other face to face six or seven times in a single year. We know the rapport that they have together, but it also reflects the hard work and integration of our governments. That in turn reflects business investment and the people-to-people ties. We have a record number of visas that we're going to process this year in our consulates and in our embassy from India. So that's reflecting, I think that India loves America and America loves India,\" he said.The former mayor of Los Angeles has been in India for the last few months, during which he says he has fallen in love with India all over again.advertisementREAD | Jaishankar explains how PM Modi's US visit was different from other PMs' visits\"The people, the culture, the food, the diversity, the struggle, the success. This is in so many ways, the future, but it also links us in so many ways to the past. It's a unique country, a crossroads and a bridge. And for me, I want to introduce more Americans to India. Part of my job as an ambassador is not just to bring India to America, but to bring America to India so that we can see that,” he said.\"I do think that this chapter, I'm noticing it whether it's in the buildings coming up in Hyderabad, whether it's the infrastructure that I saw in Mumbai and Kolkata that's being done, or just even at the village level chaiwala using UPI to accept a payment that India isn't just someone's back office. It isn't just coming out of poverty. It's producing ideas, it's producing companies, it's producing things that are improving people's lives and potentially throughout the world,” he said.\"So I think if we strengthen this bridge (in) both directions, really, we can do anything together, whether it's health, whether it's defence, whether it's economic prosperity or even women's empowerment,” Garcetti added. \n",

Photo: PIBPravin SawhneyDiplomacySecuritySouth AsiaWorld26/Jun/2023Geopolitical rivalry with China has brought India and the US into the tight strategic embrace which was on ample display during the recent state visit to Washington of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US needs India for global geopolitics while India wants the US for regional geopolitics.\n",
    "The only problem is that the US, having identified China as its sole geopolitical competitor in this century – with the capability to match it in economy, technology, diplomacy, and military – has failed to accept that its deterrence (military power) model of the Cold War is unsuitable against the Chinese geopolitical model, which is based more on global cooperation for prosperity than military power alone.\n",
    "Even in a fragmented world, the Chinese model cannot fail. Changing the game from free trade to weaponised trade by ‘decoupling’ or ‘de-risking’ value chains and supply chain networks from dependence on China – still the world’s biggest trading partner – will only add to geopolitical tensions with the global economy heading towards recession.\n",
    "Unmindful of the disastrous fall-out of the Ukraine war on the global economic order led by the US dollar, the reluctance of its regional allies to openly confront China and the own recent experience of its top diplomat being lectured by Chinese supremo Xi Jinping, the US has decided to bet on India to build it as a military bulwark against China in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).\n",
    "The long-term bet is based on the assumption that Prime Minister Modi will win the 2024 general elections and will not normalise India’s relations with China in this decade — the time it would take for deliverables promised by each side to take shape. The other assumption is that, if push comes to shove, India, as claimed by its political and military leadership, will be able to take on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a border war.\n",
    "Ironically, the huge jubilation in India regarding the Modi visit missed the point that under the new transactional arrangement, India would end up giving far more, including its strategic autonomy, than it will get in return – which will be further accentuated by the US’s irrepressible urge (as seen during the 2005-2008 civil nuclear deal negotiations) to shift the goalposts.\n",
    "The US agenda\n",
    "So, what does the US want from India?\n",
    "It wants commonality of military equipment by slowly weaning India (the largest arms importer in the world) away from Russia, its traditional, affordable, and trusted partner. It wants to improve Indian naval dockyards to serve as temporary military bases for its assets (vessels of all hue, including nuclear submarines and carriers) in the IOR. It also wants the Indian military (especially the navy) to do advanced exercises bilaterally and multi-laterally with the Quad navies for developing interoperability for combat in the IOR, which India considers its backwaters. Since the character of war has changed with new-age technologies, the US wants to pull up the technological level of the Indian military through the newly crafted India-United States Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), which is part of the bigger Innovation on Critical and Emerging Technologies (ICET) framework whereby it will be able to operate within the US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) defence network under its ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy by the end of this decade.\n",
    "All this has become possible as India (which is neither a military ally nor a non-NATO ally) has signed the US military’s four foundational agreements which qualify it to be part of the US’s new age networks. Thus, by 2030, India will fulfil all the requirements for interoperability: commonality of equipment, advanced military exercises, combat support facilities like MROs (maintenance, repair, operations) from the US, and familiarity with various war contingencies in the IOR.\n",
    "Moreover, as part of iCET, India will adopt US rules, regulatory, norms, and standards in the new age fourth industrial technologies for trade and commerce since US companies will have first user advantage in India. Thus, given the certainty of the splinternet (bifurcation of the Internet and the value supply chains) based on US and Chinese technologies, India will get strategically isolated from its South Asian neighbours, all of which are onboard the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative), which will be based on the Chinese internet by 2030.\n",
    "GE engines and technology transfer\n",
    "Let’s now examine the deals individually, starting with General Electric’s memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).\n",
    "According to the GE press release, it will deliver 99 F-414 engines for Indian Air Force (IAF) Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mk2 programme. GE will also help with the ‘prototype development, testing, and certification of the AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft) programme with its F-414-INS6 engine’. Moreover, GE will provide 99 F-404 engines for the LCA Mk1 programme. Both GE engines (F-404 and F-414) have already been part of the development of LCA Mk1 and LCA Mk2 programmes.\n",
    "Three observations are in order. One, there will be no transfer of technology (ToT) of turbofan and casting technologies and even metallurgy formulae which make up almost 95 per cent of the engine’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). It stands to logic that GE, which has spent huge amounts of time, resources, and talent creating the engine, cannot hand over its IPRs to India and create a competitor for itself. All India will get is engine assembly rights (called indigenous production in India), like we have for Russian AL-31FP engines for the Su-30MKI, which are being made in Koraput since 2004. The remaining five per cent ToT which includes tools for engine maintenance may be allowed by GE after the US Congress clears it. Thus, the IAF will be saddled with the burden of maintaining yet another engine besides British, Russian, and French.\n",
    "Two, the US will make a strong bid for the IAF’s urgent operational need of 114 fighter jets under the Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) and the Indian Navy’s carrier-borne fighter programmes, in both of which Boeing’s Super Hornet, powered by GE-F414 engines, is a contender. Cheaper than the Rafale, the Super Hornet has been in US military service since 1999 with various upgrades. The IAF will be saddled with one more fighter, when it wants to reduce its types of combat aircraft. The Super Hornet, if it comes to the IAF and the Indian Navy, will be Prime Minister Modi’s choice rather than the Services’ Headquarters, which favours Rafale.\n",
    "Three, while care will be taken by the Indian side to make an impregnable legal case against US sanctions on GE F-414, the US is not known to care much for legalities. A case in point is the freedom of navigation patrols by US Navy vessels in the South China Sea (SCS) and Taiwan Strait citing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) when the US has not even ratified the universal convention.\n",
    "Why drones are no big deal\n",
    "Regarding drones, India has agreed to buy 31 General Atomics (GA) MQ-9B (Sea Guardian and Sky Guardian) armed and unarmed drones under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) for the price of approximately US$3 billion. The offset amount of this deal will be used by GA to establish an MRO facility in India. These drones (also called Predators and Reapers) are extremely expensive, slow-moving, and completely out of sync with present and future trends in warfare. On the positive side, these drones carry big payloads, and have good range and mission capability since they are equipped with electro-optic video cameras, laser designators, good communication relay with ground stations, good electromagnetic systems, and signal intelligent equipment. They also have endurance of 40 hours. On the downside, with slow speed they are vulnerable and can be shot down by enemy air defence systems. Moreover, they lack autonomy (AI), are not stealthy and, most of all, require a lot of people on the ground to operate them.\n",
    "Representative image of a MQ-9 drone. Photo: Twitter\n",
    "In his book Army of None, US analyst Paul Scharre writes, ‘Predator and Reaper drone operations require seven to ten pilots to staff one drone orbit of 24/7 continuous around-the-clock coverage over an area. Another 20 people per orbit are required to operate the sensors on the drone, and scores of intelligence analysts are needed to sift through the sensor data. In fact, because of these substantial personnel requirements, the US Air Force has a strong resistance to calling these aircraft unmanned.’\n",
    "The irony is that when these UAVs had a lucrative market in the early 2000s, US laws did not allow their sale. Now, when the US has approved their export, many more cost-effective and better-performing drones with AI options are available. Incidentally, China is a leading exporter of military drones. There can only be two reasons for India buying these outdated and expensive drones: US pressure and the Indian military’s tendency to conflate capability with sophisticated weapon platforms.\n",
    "What iCET and INDUS-X really represent\n",
    "The US pressure for this purchase is for its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) under the Indo-Pacific partnership which was announced in Tokyo in 2022. Under this, the Quad members are to do data collection and sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) feeds with partners in Southeast Asia and Pacific nations. India, given its location, has a special responsibility which is evident from two things: It is the only country which has operational interaction with three US theatre commands namely, INDOPACOM, Central Command, and Africa Command. And the Indian Navy’s Gurgaon-based Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC), whose software has been supplied by US companies CISCO and Raytheon, will be the nerve centre of the MDA project. To keep data cyber-secure, new undersea cables will be laid connecting all Quad members.\n",
    "To understand the iCET framework and the INDUS-X scheme – which have been touted as the biggest US offering to India since the civil-nuclear deal – it is essential to first understand the context. Following the 2012 discovery of Deep Learning which revolutionised AI, and conscious that most emerging technologies including AI were being incubated in the commercial sector, the Pentagon in 2015 opened its outpost called Defence Innovation Unit (DIU) in Silicon Valley. Staffed with mostly civilian software experts and a few retired and active-duty military officers, the DIU was to help identify advanced commercial technologies for military use.\n",
    "Taking a cue from the Pentagon’s DIU, the Indian defence ministry, in April 2018, launched the Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX) scheme under the defence secretary for incubation of new age technologies development in defence and aerospace from within the industry, start-ups, civilian laboratories, academia and so on. Unfortunately, iDEX has not delivered for four reasons: it is headed by bureaucrats with little domain knowledge, many start-ups that get good funding are owned by former military officers with questionable links in the system, deserving start-ups with few resources are bought by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, and projects are time-bound, which stymies creativity, ideas, and innovations.\n",
    "Worse, there is little clarity on new-age commercial technologies prioritisation and how to harness them for military use. For instance, there are 20 advanced commercial technologies to choose from for military use. These are AI (where all new age technologies converge), 5G wireless and advanced networking, sensors with edge computing, Internet of Things, biotechnology, robotics and autonomy, semiconductors, blockchain, virtual reality (for simulation), metaverse, star-link internet, natural languages processing, space, cyber, advanced manufacturing, energy storage technologies, quantum computing, brain-computer interface, genomics, and exoskeletons.\n",
    "Meanwhile, aware that talent is the most important pillar of AI alongside data, hardware (microelectronics), and software (algorithms), and with many talented Chinese AI researchers leaving the US for China following the tech war, the US, which attracts talent from across the world (mostly Chinese and Indians) to remain the global innovation hub, seemed to be losing the competition for talent to China.\n",
    "Against this backdrop, the Indian and US National Security Advisors met in January 2023 to launch the ICET framework to be the bridge between commercial and defence sectors. Under the ICET, the two sides launched the INDUS-X scheme chaired jointly by the Pentagon and India’s iDEX to identify Indian defence start-ups which will work with the US start-ups organised by the civilian US-India Business Council (USIBC) to design, prototype, test, and produce commercial technologies with application in ‘integrated deterrence’ network. While in theory, the money for identified start-ups will come from a joint development fund, in practice they will be funded by the Pentagon. This way, the US military will be able to match, if not beat, the PLA’s 2035 deadline of robotic war (called intelligentised war) and make up for its talent shortage using Indian researchers to meet the Chinese challenge of becoming the world’s primary AI innovation centre by 2030.\n",
    "It is for this reason that the US is easing H1B and L1 visas procedures for Indian STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates and research scholars to work in the US. This is a good thing for Indian scholars and start-ups who will gain knowledge by working in world-class innovation hubs. Of course, it would have been better if the Indian civilian start-ups could work directly with the DIU (instead of through the iDEX and the Pentagon) for the understanding of all advanced commercial technologies.\n",
    "However, for India which prided itself on its strategic autonomy in foreign policy, allowing Indian shipyards to emerge ‘as a hub for maintenance and repair of forward deployed (in the IOR) US navy assets (navy ships and naval fighters)’ is too big a price to pay for Modi’s rousing welcome in the US. Taking forward the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (LEMOA) signed by the Modi government in 2016, which allowed re-fuelling and other turn-around facilities to the US naval assets on a case-to-case basis, the present arrangement will permit the US to upgrade Indian shipyards to berth US warships for long periods. Shorn of rhetoric, India has agreed to provide military basing to the US military.\n",
    "Also Read: Six (of Many) Reasons Why PM Modi’s Words on Democracy in the White House Ring Hollow\n",
    "The impact on China\n",
    "The big question now is: How will China assess India’s tight embrace of the US? China will conclude that normalisation of relations with the Modi government will not be possible since India has sacrificed its strategic autonomy to accommodate US military interests in the IOR.\n",
    "Worse, India has become the US’s first line of offence against Chinese interests and infrastructure in the South Asian region (by denouncing its Belt and Road Initiative as a debt trap). Moreover, in cahoots with the US, India will be seen to threaten China’s commerce and trade worth over US$4 trillion annually which passes through the 3,000 nautical miles IOR from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. This, at a time when the Chinese deterrence in the IOR is a decade away.\n",
    "Xi Jinping’s directive to the PLA was to prepare capabilities (deterrence) to meet the (US) challenge in West Pacific and the Indian border by 2027, and across Asia Pacific (including IOR) by 2035. The PLA has already achieved deterrence (and capabilities to fight if deterrence failed) ahead of its timeline in the West Pacific and is working on the entire region.\n",
    "Chinese Presindent Xi Jinping. Photo: Paul Kagame/Flickr CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n",
    "China’s deterrence in the West Pacific where it faces challenges in the Taiwan Strait and the South and East China Sea is based on the combination of its military power and economic power (its intense trade with ASEAN and US allies like Japan and South Korea). Given the advantage of its geography, and the formidable Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) firewall that the PLA has created against the US, China refused Antony Blinken’s request in Beijing for opening bilateral military communication to avert a crisis in the region. While the stated reason by China for doing this are the US sanctions on its defence minister, Gen. Li Shangfu, the actual reason is to discourage US freedom of navigation and air patrols in the waters and air space in the Chinese backyard. Much in line with the US’s Monroe Doctrine – which disallows the presence of outside powers in the Western hemisphere – China wants US military activities in West Pacific to end.\n",
    "Meanwhile, aware of its eroded deterrence in the West Pacific, the US military is reinforcing its regional alliances, seeking a global role for NATO and strengthening its military bases in Hawaii and Guam.\n",
    "Chinese deterrence outside the West Pacific will be based on its economic deterrence anchored on BRICS and BRI, and its military deterrence anchored on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and cooperative security with nations onboard the BRI. Since prosperity is at the vanguard of the BRI, Xi Jinping has announced that the third BRI Forum will be held in Beijing this year. The actual dates of the Forum perhaps await progress on Xi’s pet project of ‘Xiongan (meaning brave and peaceful) New Area’, 100km outside Beijing which is being called the vice-capital of China. Named the ‘plan of a thousand years’ by Xi, this city, meant to de-congest Beijing by moving many governments, financial, medical, academic, and military headquarters here, is being built with cyberspace software connectivity (part of the Digital Silk Road, a sub-set of the BRI) using industrial internet technologies like blockchain, 5G, IoT, big data and so on. This smart city will become the blockchain hub in China with blockchain-based services. Given this, it will be a good idea for Xi to showcase this smart city close to Beijing to the Forum delegates for them to get a sense of how the new phase of BRI (cyberspace software connectivity) which will likely figure in Xi’s address, would usher in prosperity by industrial internet.\n",
    "China’s economic deterrence for BRI nations will get delayed owing to the chip war with the US. For example, China has been denied advanced chips which are required in AI and data centres for computing, storage, and for servers. Slowing economic deterrence will affect military deterrence which is based on cooperative security (PLA working with host BRI nation’s security forces for the protection of Chinese infrastructure, interests, and people).\n",
    "Given the likelihood of China’s military deterrence lagging behind the US – which is supported now by India in South Asia and the IOR – Beijing might decide to up the ante on its border. Since China sees the boundary problem with India as a dispute regarding its sovereignty, it may decide to upend the US’s growing integrated deterrence in the region by a short and decisive war with India. In that sense, Modi’s US embrace has increased India’s vulnerabilities.\n",

    "The State Visit highlighted important steps in trade resolutions as the U.S. and India agreed to resolve six separate trade disputes at the World Trade Organization, including President Trump’s previous tariffs on steel and aluminum and India’s retaliatory duties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent State Visit to the US has been a resounding success, garnering significant attention as India holds the G20 presidency amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, impacting global food and energy security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Mukesh Aghi, President & CEO of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), shared his insights with Huma Siddiqui on the visit and the inked deals, shedding light on the visit’s significance and the robust agreements achieved in critical and emerging technologies and defence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visit was symbolic and only the third state visit for an Indian leader, the last being in 2009 and the third state visit hosted by the Biden administration. So, this clearly reflected the importance of India and India’s place in the world for the Biden Administration.\n",
    "\n",
    "But beyond the ceremonial festivities, the visit was extremely successful and elevated the strategic partnership to the next level with robust agreements in critical and emerging technologies and defense particularly. The deals pertaining to jet engines, drones, semiconductor investments, working together from the seas to the stars from joint-space cooperation, and enhanced underwater domain awareness. The priorities are also towards a clean energy future, building new resilient supply chains as India ramps up its manufacturing potential. The US-India partnership remains committed to a peaceful end to hostilities in Eastern Europe and securing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n",
    "\n",
    "The priority is to secure a clean energy future and one where American investment in India’s clean energy potential will wean India of needing Russian energy imports. Presently India imports oil from Russia factoring in India’s energy security priorities. But gradual steps are being made and the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership between India and the United States. These are the steps in the right direction, as it works towards energy security and electrification. It’s a gradual process and needs to be done in phases. Washington understands New Delhi’s energy priorities and understands New Delhi is firmly aligned with Washington’s geopolitical priorities in the Indo-Pacific as Beijing increases its hostilities. So, India’s energy imports are purely for its own energy security and will not dampen the strong partnership with Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "India is the fastest growing economy and now the largest populous nation on the planet. India needs to add 12-15 million jobs a year in order to remain competitive and add new jobs to those joining the workforce. Services alone can’t solve this and need to focus on manufacturing sectors as well. For this to happen, the bulk of the investments need to come in from American companies and investors. The United States is the largest economy and the synergy between the US and India is strong in areas like tech, energy, defense, and healthcare. Prime Minister Modi’s government has worked to improve the business environment. Examples like the Air India-Boeing deal, and Apple opening its first retail store in India are strong examples of the strength of the commercial relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are also examples of the growing strength of the manufacturing economy, as it sends a signal to American high-tech multinationals to come and “Make in India”. India is working to build its manufacturing economy, especially for cutting-edge tech products. The other priorities for both Washington and New Delhi are to build supply chain resilience and diversify supply chains away from China as companies in boardrooms look at a China-plus-one strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The State Visit highlighted important steps in trade resolutions as the U.S. and India agreed to resolve six separate trade disputes at the World Trade Organization, including President Trump’s previous tariffs on steel and aluminum and India’s retaliatory duties. While there is no existing trade agreement, the signs are still auspicious as India and the US have restarted the Trade Policy Forum (TPF) to solve existing issues. One needs to understand that diplomatic ties are not concurrent with trade relations. Even the US and Canada which share excellent diplomatic ties can spar over trade issues. India has signed several FTAs with countries like the UAE and Australia and is working on trade deals with the UK, so the current government is removing some of the previous protectionist tendencies that were evinced in India. We are seeing gradual opening with mangoes, pomegranates from India coming to the US and pork and hay coming from the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Delhi has also agreed to remove retaliatory tariffs on certain US products, agricultural primarily in chickpeas, lentils, almonds, walnuts, and apples. So, as you can see, there is no boiling the ocean strategy, but gradual phases of removing existing barriers that will pave the way for a more auspicious trade environment and then perhaps we can speak of larger trade deals\n",

    "Welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House this week for a state visit – the most elevated form of American diplomacy – required President Joe Biden to make certain trade-offs and Modi to step out of his comfort zone, for at least a few minutes.\n",
    "Modi, massively popular in India, has demonstrated a drift toward authoritarianism that has worried the West. He’s cracked down on dissent, targeted journalists and introduced policies that human rights groups say discriminate against Muslims.\n",
    "Yet Modi and India, the world’s largest democracy, also represent a lynchpin in Biden’s strategy in Asia. The country recently surpassed China to become the most populous country on Earth. No major global challenge, from climate change to advances in technology, can be addressed without India’s buy-in, in Biden’s view. And in an era of growing tensions between the US and China, there are few partners that Biden is more eager to cultivate.\n",
    "That, according to officials, was the rationale behind inviting Modi for a state visit, only the third of Biden’s presidency so far.\n",
    "And so on Thursday the prime minister was welcomed to the White House with the highest trappings of American friendship: Marching troops on the South Lawn, extensive Oval Office talks and a state dinner in the evening, complete with a chef who specializes in plant-based cuisine to accommodate Modi’s vegetarian diet.\n",
    "“I’ve long believed the relationship between the United States and India … will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century,” Biden said during an elaborate welcome ceremony during which he hailed the friendship between the US and India.\n",
    "Modi takes reporters’ questions in remarkable moment\n",
    "Later, when the two leaders held a joint news conference that had been subject of intense negotiations between American and Indian officials, it was only Biden who called on reporters.\n",
    "But Modi, for one of the only times since he assumed power, also responded to a question about his crackdowns on dissent and treatment of religious minorities.\n",
    "“There’s absolutely no space for discrimination,” Modi said through a translator. ‘When you talk of democracy, if there are no human values and there is no humanity, there are no human rights, then it’s not a democracy.”\n",
    "It was a remarkable moment for a leader who rarely holds news conferences, takes questions from the press or sits for international interviews. Press freedom groups say he’s overseen a crackdown on reporting.\n",
    "The format of the news conference was only agreed upon after lengthy, delicate negotiations between the two sides. Indian officials initially balked at the White House’s insistence at holding one, two US officials familiar with the matter said.\n",
    "Biden, in his own answer on Modi’s human rights record, underscored the shared values between the US and India.\n",
    "“The prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values,” he said. “That’s the nature of our relationship, we’re straightforward with each other and we respect each other.”\n",
    "“I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen, and it is in American’s DNA, and I believe in India’s DNA,” the president told reporters Thursday, adding that the two countries’ commitment to democracy “makes us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across around the world.”\n",
    "An important international relationship\n",
    "As he welcomed Modi to the White House earlier in the day, Biden sought to underscore the importance of shared values in the relationship moving forward.\n",
    "“As democracies, we can better tap into the full talent of all of our people, and attract investments as true and trusted partners as leading nations, with our greatest export being the power of our example,” Biden said from a podium on the South Lawn. “Equity under the law, freedom of expression, religious pluralism and the diversity of our people. These core principles have endured and evolved even as they have faced challenges throughout each of our nation’s histories and fuel our strength, depth and future.”\n",

    "Andrew Harnik/AP\n",
    "The meetings Thursday produced agreements on technology and defense cooperation and highlighted Biden’s efforts to shore up relationships in a region grappling with an increasingly aggressive Beijing.\n",
    "Also up for discussion was Russia’s continuing war in Ukraine, a conflict on which India has not taken a definitive side. New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil has helped prop up Moscow amid withering global sanctions.\n",
    "“Fundamentally, we believe that the long-term trajectory of the US-India relationship is built on the notion that two democracies with shared value systems ought to be able to work together,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told a group of reporters ahead of the visit.\n",
    "“That’s a long view. That’s a view rooted in our bet on the relationship between the people of the United States of America and the people of India,” Sullivan continued. “Part of what will be lifted up and celebrated in this visit will be those deep people and people ties.”\n",

    "Courting a controversial leader\n",
    "Modi is hardly the first leader with authoritarian tendencies to be invited for a state visit at the White House. President Barack Obama hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, shortly after he assumed power in Beijing.\n",
    "And Biden is not the first president to embrace Modi. Alongside President Donald Trump, the Indian prime minister attended a massive “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston for members of the Indian diaspora. Modi returned the favor in Ahmedabad with a “Namaste Trump” event held in the world’s largest cricket stadium.\n",

    "Evan Vucci/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n",
    "Other world leaders have offered a similar welcome. French President Emmanuel Macron will host Modi as the guest of honor at this year’s Bastille Day parade.\n",
    "But Biden has made as a centerpiece of his foreign policy the battle between “democracy and autocracy,” a thematic backdrop perhaps nowhere more relevant than in India.\n",
    "In March, the former leader of India’s main opposition political party, Rahul Gandhi, was disqualified as a lawmaker a day after he was handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation in a ruling his supporters called politically motivated.\n",
    "Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come under scrutiny from rights groups and opposition lawmakers for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent.\n",
    "Modi himself was denied a visa to the United States in 2005 because of his alleged role in anti-Muslim violence three years earlier in Gujarat state, where he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. A Supreme Court-ordered investigation in India absolved him of blame.\n",
    "A wide array of human rights groups, lawmakers and dissidents have made clear they want Biden to raise his concerns on Modi’s record when he’s at the White House. A group of more than 70 congressional Democrats wrote a letter to Biden this week urging him to bring up human rights concerns when he meets with Modi.\n",
    "“You have once again made respect for human rights, press freedom, religious freedom, and pluralism core tenets of American foreign policy. Moreover, these tenets are necessary to the functioning of true democracy. In order to advance these values with credibility on the world stage, we must apply them equally to friend and foe alike, just as we work to apply these same principles here in the United States,” the lawmakers wrote.\n",
    " U.S. President Joe Biden (R) and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meet in the Oval Office at the White House on June 22, 2023 in Washington, DC. Biden and Prime Minister Modi will later participate in a joint press conference and a state dinner in the evening. Biden is the first U.S. president to invite Modi for an official state visit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The letter was spearheaded by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat. Jayapal said in a tweet about the letter, “We must ensure freedom of the press, religious tolerance, internet access, & the diversity of political thought.”\n",
    "Six Democratic lawmakers boycotted Modi’s address to Congress Thursday. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pointed before the address to Modi’s treatment of Muslims.\n",
    "Grappling with China’s influence\n",
    "Thursday’s state visit included announcements in the technology space as well as defense cooperation, including on defense sales, production and technology collaboration, an administration official said.\n",
    "American defense trade with India had boomed in the past 15 years, and US officials have noted India is diversifying away from relying on any one nation, like Russia, for arms.\n",
    "“You’ll see major cancellations of defense system purchases from Russia, in part because we know Russia can’t actually provide it, that Russia is consuming its own defense production very quickly in this terrible war in Ukraine,” a senior administration official said. “And everyone around the world who buys Russian equipment is worried about whether they can get spare parts and then new systems, given the supply chain problems that Russia is experiencing.”\n",
    "Among the announcements Thursday was that India has committed to the purchase of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, deepening the two nations’ military ties amidst the backdrop of an increasingly bellicose China.\n",
    "Biden and Modi planned an agreement between US manufacturer GE and the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics to jointly produce F414 jet engines in India.\n",
    "Other announcements included India joining the US-led Artemis Accords, an international cooperative agreement for space exploration, mounting a joint-mission with NASA to the International Space Station in 2024 and a commitment from US-based semiconductor producer Micron Technology to break ground on a $2.75 billion new semiconductor assembly and test facility in India.\n",
    "The discussions between the two men also touched on enhancing educational exchanges and were expected to feature new steps forward on visas and diplomatic presence in each country.\n",
    "They also discussed agenda issues for the G20 summit, which India is preparing to host in September.\n",
    "Biden’s efforts to deepen ties with India comes as the two countries grapple with the growing influence of China. The president has met with Modi on several occasions, including through meetings of the Quad leaders.\n",
    "He said at a fundraiser this week that his revival of the four-way alliance had upset Xi.\n",
    "“He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind,” Biden said, referring to the Chinese president. “We’re just trying to make sure the international rules of air and sea lanes remain open.”\n",
    "Sullivan, however, said Thursday’s visit at the White House was “not about China,” though “the question of China’s role in the military domain, the technology domain, the economic domain will be on the agenda.”\n",
    "This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n",
    "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized how often Modi engages with the media. News conferences and international interviews are rare but they have occurred.\n",

    "|Narendra ModiWhat’s behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s US visit?The US is seeking stronger ties with India, which it sees as a vital ally in efforts to contain China’s rise.US President Joe Biden speaks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit in November [File: Prasetyo Utomo/G20 Media Center/Handout via Reuters]By Brian OsgoodPublished On 21 Jun 202321 Jun 2023The administration of United States President Joe Biden is scheduled to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an official visit later this week, as the two countries strengthen their ties amid shared antipathy towards China’s growing influence.\n",
    "The White House will hold a state dinner in Modi’s honour on June 22, a sign of the burgeoning relationship between the two powers who have stepped up cooperation in areas such as trade and arms sales.\n",
    "In a press release, the Biden administration said that a recent trip to New Delhi by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan “underscored the dynamism of the US-India partnership in advance of Prime Minister Modi’s historic official state visit next week to the United States”.\n",
    "But human rights groups say the celebratory dinner is a de facto endorsement of India’s far-right turn under Modi’s leadership — and undermines the Biden administration’s stated goal of emphasising human rights and democracy in its foreign policy.\n",
    "During Modi’s tenure, India’s Muslims and other minorities have experienced an uptick in violence and repression as the government leans into a form of Hindu nationalism known as Hindutva. Modi has also been criticised for seeking to consolidate power and crack down on dissent.\n",
    "“A state dinner is a special occasion; it’s not something that just any foreign leader receives,” Edward Mitchell, the deputy executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told Al Jazeera over a phone call.\n",
    "“How can the White House honour a leader who is an open anti-Muslim bigot, a right-wing ideologue who censors journalists and turns a blind eye to lynchings? You can work with India and Modi without taking this extra step to celebrate him.”\n",
    "Confronting China\n",
    "While advocacy groups have called for greater scrutiny of India’s human rights record, foreign policy experts say the Biden administration is primarily interested in the country as a potential counterweight to China, which the US sees as its most formidable global competitor.\n",
    "Sarang Shidore, Director of Studies and Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute, a US-based think tank, told Al Jazeera that he believes the US-India relationship will continue to grow as long as their shared concern over China remains in place.\n",
    "“The United States does not conduct its foreign policy based on democracy and human rights. It conducts its foreign policy based on its interests, as all states do,” Shidore said.\n",
    "China’s growing military power and assertive territorial claims have become a source of concern for nearby Asian countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and India. The US has worked to fashion alliances with many of those countries in an attempt to contain China’s expanding influence.\n",
    "“No question, there is increased Chinese nationalism,” said Shidore. “And China sees India as an increasing challenge due to its relationship with the US.”\n",
    "Expanding ties\n",
    "That was not always the case. During the Cold War, India’s relations with the US were often frosty. The country had cultivated close ties with the USSR and helped spearhead the Non-Aligned Movement, an organisation of countries that rejected pressures to join either pro-US or pro-Soviet blocs.\n",
    "For its part, the US was a key ally of Pakistan. And by the early 1970s, the administration of US President Richard Nixon started to build a cooperative relationship with China, as an attempt, in part, to place pressure on the USSR.\n",
    "But as the Cold War ended and China’s economic rise became a preoccupation of US foreign policy, India — with its size and economic heft — started to be seen as a key regional ally.\n",
    "Despite its improved ties with the US, however, India has continued to resist what it sees as a false choice between the US and countries like President Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\n",
    "But as Russia wages war in Ukraine and Washington seeks to isolate Moscow economically and diplomatically, that balancing act has become more difficult for India to maintain.\n",
    "While India has increased its purchase of weapons from countries such as France and the US and recently agreed on a roadmap to increase cooperation with the US defence industry, it remains the world’s largest importer of Russian arms.\n",
    "India has also joined China in buying up Russian oil at discounted prices, while the US and the European Union angle to limit Russia’s power in the global energy market.\n",
    "But Shidore said that India’s status as a central player in Washington’s Asia strategy gives it significant leverage. Its ties to Russia are not likely to get in the way of its relationship with the US, he explained.\n",
    "“India has played this quite well, playing Russia and the US off each other, and has benefitted in the process,” he said. “A country like India, which has such a strong convergence with the US on China, can create major spaces where it will differ very strongly from the US and can ride that out.”\n",
    "Consolidating control\n",
    "While US relations with allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel have come under political scrutiny in recent years, Modi’s trip to the US has been welcomed with bipartisan support. An a joint letter inviting Modi to address Congress during his visit, members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have hailed the visit as a sign of the “enduring friendship” between the two countries.\n",
    "“During your address, you will have the opportunity to share your vision for India’s future and speak to the global challenges our countries both face,” the letter reads.\n",
    "However, Modi’s human rights record has not gone entirely unremarked. On Tuesday, a group of more than 70 lawmakers from the US House and Senate penned a letter to the Biden urging him to discuss concerns about religious freedom and journalistic expression in his talks with Modi.\n",
    "The Muslim rights group CAIR, meanwhile, has issued a statement calling on the White House to drop its plans for a state dinner.\n",
    "Modi’s high-profile reception in the US is a far cry from what he experienced before he was first elected prime minister in 2014. Prior to becoming India’s leader, Modi had been banned from entering the US due to allegations that he turned a blind eye to anti-Muslim violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was the province’s chief minister.\n",
    "The deadly 2002 riots were the subject of a BBC documentary that Modi tried to ban in January, invoking his emergency powers as prime minister. The rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch screened the documentary in Washington on Tuesday.\n",
    "Human rights groups say the move to ban the film was representative of a larger effort under Modi to stifle dissent and exercise control over independent institutions. They also accuse his government of pursuing an agenda influenced by far-right Hindu nationalism.\n",
    "In an annual report on religious freedom in May, the US State Department expressed concern about the situation in India, noting that there were “open calls for genocide against Muslims”, lynchings and “attacks on places of worship”.\n",
    "In May, for the fourth year in a row, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom called on the State Department to designate India as a “country of particular concern”.\n",
    "In some states controlled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), politicians who lean into violent anti-Muslim rhetoric face little reprimand. Some Hindu nationalist paramilitaries have also waged a campaign against interfaith marriages, which they portray as an effort to dilute the Hindu population and win converts to Islam through “love jihad”.\n",
    "Shidore, however, said that Modi’s human rights record has been quickly “papered over” and is unlikely to prevent cooperation with the US, so long as China remains a serious global competitor.\n",
    "“The United States”, he said, “has set human rights issues aside in order to strengthen ties”\n",

    "CongressWASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Narendra Modi hailed a new era in their countries' relationship after the White House rolled out the red carpet for the Indian prime minister on Thursday, touting deals on defense and commerce aimed at countering China's global influence.“Two great nations, two great friends, and two great powers. Cheers,\" Biden told Modi in a toast at a state dinner. Modi said in reply: “You are soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong.”Though the countries are not formal treaty-bound allies and India has long relished its independence, Washington wants Delhi to be a strategic counterweight to China. While neither leader criticized Beijing directly in official statements, they alluded to the Xi Jinping-led government.\"The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific,\" Modi told Congress. \"The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership.\"After Biden and Modi spoke privately for more than two hours, a joint statement included a warning of rising tensions and destabilizing actions in the East and South China Sea and stressed the importance of international law and freedom of navigation.\"The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,\" Biden said as he welcomed Modi to the White House.The state dinner, held in a large, elaborately erected tent on the White House South Lawn, featured a number of Silicon Valley executives on the guest list, including Apple's Tim Cook, 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, among others.With the slightly Indian-accented dinner, the Bidens followed a White House tradition of serving guests from abroad food that has faint echoes of home with a strong American bent.Modi is seeking to raise the status that India, the world's most populous country at 1.4 billion and fifth-largest economy, has on the world stage as a manufacturing and diplomatic powerhouse while navigating strained ties with China.His participation in a White House press conference itself was a reflection of contrasting political traditions, marking the first time Modi has taken questions in such a format in his nine-year tenure. He took one question apiece from an American and an Indian journalist selected in advance, and dismissed criticism about India's human rights record.Washington has been frustrated by India's close ties with Russia while Moscow wages war in Ukraine. Modi avoided direct mention of Russia, but told lawmakers the conflict was \"causing great pain in the region. Since it involves major powers, the outcomes are severe.\"BOYCOTTS AND WELCOME CROWDSModi's visit was not without controversy. The speech to Congress, normally a bipartisan affirmation of a visiting leader from an allied nation, was boycotted by some liberal lawmakers, who cited the Modi government's treatment of India's Muslim minority.\"I encourage my colleagues who stand for pluralism, tolerance and freedom of the press to join me in doing the same,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday.[1/12]U.S. President Joe Biden and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi raise a toast during an official state dinner at the White House in Washington. REUTERS/Elizabeth FrantzModi's speech to the Congress also drew a crowd of on-lookers who chanted \"Modi, Modi\" at applause lines.As some 7,000 well-wishers gathered for a colorful opening ceremony at the White House, a far smaller group of demonstrators gathered blocks away to protest the Biden administration's coziness with Modi, who leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.Asked by a U.S. reporter about what steps he would take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities, Modi said \"there's absolutely no space for discrimination\" in India.Biden told reporters he and Modi had a straightforward discussion about democratic values.NEW US-INDIA DEALSThe two countries announced agreements on semiconductors, critical minerals, technology, space cooperation and defense cooperation and sales.Some are aimed at diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China. Others are aimed at cornering the market in advanced technologies that may feature on the battlefields of the future. They also ended disputes at the World Trade Organization, and India removed some tariffs on U.S. goods.The United States is India's largest trading partner but the U.S. has much larger trading relationships with China, the EU, and North American neighbors.Biden and Modi signed off on a deal to allow General Electric (GE.N) to produce jet engines in India to power Indian military aircraft, through an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics. (HIAE.NS)U.S. Navy ships in the region will be able to stop in Indian shipyards for repairs under a maritime agreement, and India will procure U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology's (MU.O) plans a $2.7 billion semiconductor testing and packaging unit, to be built in Modi's home state of Gujarat. The U.S. will also make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew U.S. visas.India also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and to work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said the visit so far had been \"truly pathbreaking\" and New Delhi is confident it will help take the relationship with Washington to \"higher reaches\".\"The richness of form and substance of the visit clearly tells you that it’s an exceptional, landmark, pathbreaking visit,\" Kwatra told reporters.\"The decisions taken during the visit are truly transformative across a wide range of areas.

    "Biden announces raft of new deals with Modi amid calls to address human rights concerns,A handful of lawmakers boycotted the Indian prime minister’s address to Congress, while protesters gathered near the White HouseMary Yang in Washington. Joe Biden has pronounced the US-India relationship never stronger and rolled out a series of new business deals on the second day of the Indian prime minister’s state visit, but Narendra Modi’s trip has been marked with controversy as many call for Biden to address India’s continuing crackdown on religious and press freedoms.An official state visit is the highest-ranked diplomatic invitation extended to a foreign leader and is a sign of the US president’s national security priorities as his administration courts India as a partner against China.‘India is now a linchpin’: US looks to Narendra Modi’s visit to counter ChinaRead moreIn a joint news conference with Modi, Biden called the relationship between the US and India among the most consequential in the world and “more dynamic than at any time in history.”“We talked about our shared efforts to mitigate humanitarian tragedies unleashed by Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine and to defend core principles of the UN charter,” the US president said. Modi has previously faced criticism for not more forcefully criticising Russia’s war in Ukraine.“Peace and security in the Indo-Pacific is our priority,” Modi said. “India and the US stand shoulder to shoulder in our fight against terrorism and fundamentalism.”When asked about the human rights and democratic issues in India, Biden said: “The prime minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values – that’s the nature of our relationship, we’re straightforward with each other.”Modi said he was surprised by the critique. “There is absolutely no space for discrimination,” he said. “In India the benefits provided by the government is accessible to all.”Among the announcements made on Thursday is an agreement that will allow US-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of US-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.The Biden administration also announced plans to bolster India’s semiconductor industry.“We made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next generation partnership to ensure these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, trusted and secure,” Biden said. “All this matters for America, for India and for the world.”Thousands of Indian Americans and other guests gathered on the White House south lawn to greet Modi on Thursday morning, ahead of the private meeting between the two leaders and a state dinner. Modi, India’s prime minister since 2014, also addressed a joint session of Congress on Thursday afternoon.At the same time, dozens of demonstrators gathered near the White House gates to protest the visit. Human rights advocates have accused Modi and his party, the BJP, of fueling the rise of violence associated with Hindu nationalism and discriminating against India’s Muslim minority.“The fact that Modi has been invited despite being complicit with innocent people being killed since 2002 when he was the chief minister [of Gujarat] is devastating for our communities because it’s just saying, ‘it’s OK what you do back home but you can still come here,’” said Husnaa Vhora, the advocacy associate for the DC-based non-profit Indian American Muslim council.h the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. What is the BBC Modi documentary and why is it so controversial?Read moreDozens of lawmakers had also urged Biden to address the issue of human rights with Modi in a letter on Tuesday, asking the president to raise reports of “shrinking of political space, the rise of religious intolerance, the targeting of civil society organisations and journalists and growing restrictions on press freedoms and internet access” in India.A handful of representatives, including Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, who are Muslim, boycotted Modi’s address to Congress. The Indian leader focused on unity in that message.“The beauty of democracy is the constant connect with the people, to listen to them and feel their pulse,” said Modi, who shook hands with applauding members of Congress as he walked down to the front. It was his second time addressing both chambers of Congress, the first being in 2016. “We are home to all faiths in the world, and we celebrate all of them,” Modi claimed in his speech on Thursday.As expected, Biden balanced lawmakers and human rights advocates’ concerns with the US’s desire to deepen ties with India, a major trading partner and a counterweight to China.“China is in the background of all of these meetings,” said Tamanna Salikuddin, the director of South Asia programs at the non-partisan US Institute of Peace. “There is real convergence between the US and India on China.”Since 2020, India has seen deadly confrontations along its border with China, and security in the Indo-Pacific has become a shared priority. “India is, I think, one of the leading partners we have in [the Biden administration’s] Indo-Pacific strategy,” she said\n",
